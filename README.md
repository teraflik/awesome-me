The internet is full of vast amount of resources for boosting your productivity and sharpening your skill-sets. 

Always keep in mind that everyone has a limit on the amount of time they can devote to activities that are solely for self-improvement and have little entertainment value.

Honestly this is a very useful skill, and can be a big productivity boost if utilized correctly.

Using Google is really easy, but there are also some handy tips, like try to omit frequently used words such as prepositions (in, of, on), conjunctions (and, but) and articles (a, the). 

Using specific keywords instead of long-typed out sentences can give you really concise results.

And try to steer clear of the spam links and annoying advertisements. Using good adblockers can really help for that.
